## Thunder Monk Boss Strategy

In order to defeat the Thunder Monk, you must be well-prepared. The following tips are drawn from player experiences and community feedback on how to defeat the boss effectively.

### 1. **Avoid the Thunder Strikes**
One of the Thunder Monk’s most dangerous moves is its lightning bolt attack. These strikes can deal massive damage and are often followed by a deadly AoE shockwave. Stay mobile and be prepared to dodge quickly.

### 2. **Time Your Attacks**
Timing is key when facing the Thunder Monk. Wait for it to finish its attacks before engaging, as rushing in during its lightning phase can leave you vulnerable. Use hit-and-run tactics to deal damage without getting caught.

### 3. **Use Defensive Buffs**
Many players recommend using defensive buffs to resist the Thunder Monk’s electrical attacks. Potions or gear that increase lightning resistance can significantly reduce the amount of damage you take from its attacks.

### 4. **Monitor the Monk’s Phases**
As the Thunder Monk’s health depletes, it enters different phases where it becomes more aggressive. During these phases, be extra cautious, as it will launch rapid, multiple lightning strikes that cover a wider area.

By keeping these strategies in mind and practicing your timing, you’ll increase your chances of overcoming the Thunder Monk and securing those sweet loot drops.
