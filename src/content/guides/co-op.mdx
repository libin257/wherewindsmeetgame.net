## How Does Co-Op Affect Gameplay?

The **Where Winds Meet co op** mode has a big impact on the game's dynamics. For one, the difficulty scales depending on the number of players, so what may be easy for a solo player might be much harder with a full group. But there are plenty of rewards for taking on more significant challenges:
