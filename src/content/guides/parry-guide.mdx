This **where winds meet parry guide** teaches you how to master one of the most powerful defensive techniques in *Where Winds Meet*: the perfect parry. Parrying not only negates incoming damage but also opens enemies up for devastating counterattacks. When timed correctly, perfect parries can turn even the most dangerous boss battles into stylish victories.

## What Is a Parry?

Parrying is a defensive technique that allows you to **deflect an incoming attack** at the precise moment the enemy strike connects. A successful parry:

- Cancels the enemy attack  
- Staggers the attacker  
- Opens a counter window  
- Deals posture damage  
- Prevents all incoming damage  

Perfect parrying is more rewarding but requires strict timing and focus.

Perfect parry timing is all about understanding **enemy wind-ups, animation cues, and audio signals**. This **where winds meet parry guide** focuses on recognizing patterns and reacting consistently.

### The parry window opens:
- **Right before** the enemy weapon touches your character  
- During the final frame of their swing animation  
- When the weapon motion accelerates sharply  
- When specific audio stings trigger (many bosses have “whoosh” tell-sounds)  

### The window closes:
- Immediately after contact — too late and you get hit  
- If you parry early, your guard opens and you take full damage  

Practicing consistently builds muscle memory.

Different enemies and bosses have distinct parry cues:

## 👀 Visual Cues
- Shoulder movement before the strike  
- Foot pivot or weight shift  
- Rapid weapon acceleration  
- Flash or shimmer effects for elite attacks  

## 👂 Audio Cues
- A sharper “whoosh”  
- A rising pitch before an elemental strike  
- A grunt or roar before heavy blows  

This **where winds meet parry guide** recommends using both cues together rather than relying on one.

Parry speed varies depending on what weapon you are using.

### 🗡 Light Blades / Swords  
- Fastest parry animation  
- Easiest for high-precision timing  
- Recommended for beginners learning parry timing  

### 🪝 Meteor Hammer / Greatsword  
- Slower wind-up  
- Requires slightly earlier input  
- Harder but more rewarding  

### 🐺 Spears / Halberds  
- Medium-speed parry  
- Excellent reach for follow-ups  

### 🎐 Fans / Flutes  
- Utility-based parry  
- Often used for counter setups rather than pure defense  

Weapon choice significantly impacts your parry rhythm, which is why many players learning timing use swords first.

Here is the most effective practice method from this **where winds meet parry guide**:

### 1. Start with humanoid enemies  
Their patterns are predictable and readable.

### 2. Slow down the fight  
Focus on watching animations instead of rushing.

### 3. Let the enemy attack first  
Do not spam attacks — stay defensive.

### 4. Input parry **just before** impact  
Try to match the moment the weapon touches your character.

### 5. Repeat against faster enemies  
Increase difficulty gradually.

Practicing one enemy type at a time is the fastest way to build consistency.

Understanding when parry is better than dodge is essential.

### Choose **Parry** when:
- The attack is slow and predictable  
- The enemy is humanoid or weapon-based  
- You want high posture damage  
- You’re maximizing DPS windows  

### Choose **Dodge** when:
- Facing AoE attacks  
- Enemy teleports or lunges rapidly  
- Attacks contain multi-hit strings  
- Projectiles or elemental blasts appear  

A strong player knows when to combine the two.

Parrying opens the enemy to a **counter window**, enabling:

- Heavy attacks  
- Qi Slashes  
- Weapon ultimates  
- Execution moves (for low posture bars)  
- Combo finishers  

The **where winds meet parry guide** encourages using heavy attacks after a parry because they deal bonus posture damage and often benefit from crit multipliers.

Bosses are categorized into three groups regarding parry difficulty:

### ⭐ Easy-Parry Bosses  
- Humanoid duelists  
- Predictable sword fighters  

### ⭐⭐ Moderate-Parry Bosses  
- Fast dual-blade users  
- Beast-type bosses with arm swings  
- Spear masters with long reach  

### ⭐⭐⭐ Hard-Parry Bosses  
- Teleporting illusionists  
- Elemental bosses with delayed strikes  
- Multi-phase bosses with mixed timing  

Learning individual boss patterns is essential — each has unique rhythm.

---


Once you master standard timing, try:

### ✔ Pre-Parry  
Parry *slightly* earlier with slow weapons.

### ✔ Delay-Parry  
Wait until the last possible frame — great for dual-blade enemies.

### ✔ Chain-Parry  
Parry multiple consecutive hits in combo-heavy fights.

### ✔ Parry → Backstep → Counter  
A safer alternative for high-risk bosses.

### ✔ Elemental Parry  
Some attacks require specific defensive internal skills.

Mastering these techniques elevates your gameplay dramatically.

- Spamming parry buttons  
- Watching only the weapon, not the body  
- Ignoring audio cues  
- Standing too close during wind-up  
- Attempting to parry projectiles  
- Panicking and pressing parry too early  

This **where winds meet parry guide** emphasizes *calm timing over reaction panic*.

---

Use this **where winds meet parry guide** to refine your timing, study cues, and unlock the full depth of combat elegance the game offers.
