## Introduction to Stealth

Stealth in *Where Winds Meet* combines wuxia agility, environmental awareness, and assassination tools to create a smooth infiltration system. You can:

- Sneak past guards  
- Assassinate enemies silently  
- Hide in environmental objects  
- Use disguises to infiltrate camps  
- Distract enemies using sound or thrown objects  
- Disable lights or find shadows for cover

# How Detection Works

Enemies detect you through three core systems:

### 👀 **Sight**
- Guards will notice you if you cross their line of sight.  
- Visibility increases in bright areas and decreases in shadows.  
- Crouching reduces detection range significantly.  

### 👂 **Sound**
- Running or landing from big jumps generates noise.  
- Light footsteps are nearly silent when crouched.  
- Noise-based distractions can be created with thrown objects.  

### 🧠 **Suspicion Meter**
When enemies partially detect you, a suspicion bar appears:  
- **White → Yellow:** They heard something.  
- **Yellow → Orange:** They see movement or a silhouette.  
- **Orange → Red:** They fully detect you and engage.  

The **where winds meet stealth** mechanics allow players to reset suspicion by breaking line of sight or hiding.

# Core Stealth Techniques

## 1. **Crouch Movement**
Walking while crouched is the foundation of stealth. This mode:

- Makes you harder to detect from a distance  

## 2. **Assassinations**

- Completely silent  
- Cannot assassinate some elite armored enemies  

## 3. **Environmental Hiding**
You can hide inside:

- Grass  
- Bushes  
- Behind crates  
- Behind walls and pillars  
- On rooftops  

Great for controlling guard patterns.

## 4. **Rooftop Infiltration**
The wuxia movement system allows:

- Roof-running  
- Wall climbing  
- Air-dashes  
- Gliding into enemy camps  

Vertical infiltration is one of the strongest parts of the **where winds meet stealth** system.
