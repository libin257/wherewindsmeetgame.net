### **RAM:**  
- 16 GB (dual channel strongly recommended)

### **Storage:**  
- NVMe SSD

### **DirectX:**  
- DX12

**Performance Expectation:**  
- 60–80 FPS @ High  
- Stable frame pacing in open-world traversal

---

# High-End Requirements (1440p / Ultra Settings)

If you want a premium wuxia experience with ultra textures and dense foliage:

### **CPU:**  
- Intel Core i7-12700K  
or  
- AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D

### **GPU:**  
- NVIDIA RTX 3070 Ti / 4070  
or  
- AMD RX 6800 / 7800 XT

### **RAM:**  
- 32 GB  

### **Storage:**  
- High-speed NVMe SSD (Gen 3 or Gen 4)

**Performance Expectation:**  
- 70–120 FPS @ Ultra with DLSS/FSR  
- Excellent performance in cities and forests

---

# 4K Requirements (Ultra / Ray Tracing)

For stunning 4K visuals:

### **CPU:**  
- Intel i9-12900K  
or  
- Ryzen 9 7900X

### **GPU:**  
- NVIDIA RTX 4080 / RTX 4090  
or  
- AMD RX 7900 XTX

### **RAM:**  
- 32 GB DDR4/DDR5

**Performance Expectation:**  
- 60–100+ FPS @ 4K with DLSS/FSR  
- Smooth combat and traversal, even in storms or crowded towns

---

# Expected VRAM Usage

The **where winds meet system requirements** are VRAM-heavy due to large textures and open-world streaming.

| Resolution | VRAM Needed | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| 1080p     | 4–6 GB      | Minimum playable |
| 1440p     | 6–8 GB      | Recommended |
| 4K        | 10–16 GB    | Required for Ultra textures |

A GPU with **8GB+ VRAM** is highly recommended.

---

# CPU Considerations

This game is **CPU-intensive**, especially in:

- Cities with large crowds  
- Scripted cinematic events  
- Physics-heavy battles  
- Mount traversal at high speed  

CPUs with **high single-core performance** (Intel 12th/13th gen or Ryzen 5000/7000) will perform best.

---

# Storage Requirements

Running the game on an SSD is mandatory.

### Why SSD is required:
- Huge open-world data streaming  
- Reduced loading times  
- Smooth texture loading  
- Prevents mid-fight pop-in  

HDDs will cause severe stutters and are not supported.

---

# GPU Features for Best Performance

To maximize FPS with the given **where winds meet system requirements**, enable:

- **DLSS (NVIDIA)**  
- **FSR 2/3 (AMD)**  
- **XeSS (Intel GPUs)**  

Upscaling improves both FPS and stability, especially in the open world.
