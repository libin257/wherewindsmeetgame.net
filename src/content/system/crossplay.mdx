## Does *Where Winds Meet* Have Cross-Play?

According to early platform previews and coverage, *Where Winds Meet* allows players on different platforms to interact within the same world.

This means:

- **PC → PlayStation** cross-play  
- **PlayStation → PC** cross-play  
- **No platform exclusivity barriers** for multiplayer features  

Cross-play is available for:

Current expectations based on publisher statements and Dexerto’s coverage:

### ✔ **PC (Steam / Epic)** ↔ **PlayStation 5**  
Full cross-play is supported between both platforms.

### ⚠ Potential Future Platforms  
If the game releases later on other consoles, cross-play may expand — but only PC↔PlayStation has been publicly discussed so far.

Many players also ask whether the **where winds meet crossplay** system includes **cross-save**.

### ✔ **Partial cross-save support is expected.**  
Based on developer comments and multisystem architecture, the game will likely support:

- Cosmetic entitlements carrying over  
- Character data stored on cloud servers

Examples:

- If you play on Steam and later switch to Epic (PC ecosystems), your progress should sync.  
- If you play on PlayStation and PC, cross-save *may* require linking accounts.

### ⚠ However:  
Cross-save between **PC and PlayStation** is **not fully confirmed** and may launch with restrictions depending on Sony’s policies.
