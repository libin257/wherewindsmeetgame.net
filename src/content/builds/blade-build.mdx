- **Internal Strength (Secondary)** — improves overall weapon scaling  
- **Vitality (Optional)** — for survivability  

Blade users should not over-invest in HP early — rely on mobility instead.

## Combat Gameplay & Rotation

A strong **where winds meet blade build** uses a predictable but effective rhythm:

### Basic Rotation
1. Dash-in  
2. Light Combo → Light Combo  
3. Dodge-cancel  
4. Dash behind enemy

6. Retreat  
7. Re-engage after enemy recovery

- Best for agility builds  

### ★ Ice Infusion
- Adds slow debuffs  
- Excellent vs. fast bosses  

### ★ Lightning Infusion

- Use diagonal dodges instead of sideways rolls — safer and faster.  
- Parrying with Blade gives huge counter opportunities.

- Stay close enough to pressure, but not close enough to get trapped.

Blade excels against:

- Humanoid bosses  
- Agile duelists  
- Dragons or beasts with long telegraphs  
- Shadow-type illusion enemies  

Harder matchups include:
