This **where winds meet performance settings** guide gives you fully optimized graphics settings to maximize FPS, reduce stutters, and smooth out gameplay across all hardware levels. Whether you're running a mid-range GPU or a high-refresh-rate monitor, these settings ensure *Where Winds Meet* runs at its absolute best.

---

## Why Performance Optimization Matters

*Where Winds Meet* features:

- Dense open-world regions  
- Complex physics  
- Volumetric lighting  
- Dynamic weather  
- Large cities with crowds  

All of these can strain both CPU and GPU. Proper **where winds meet performance settings** can dramatically increase FPS — often by 30–70%.

---


Below are the most effective settings to adjust, starting with the ones that impact FPS the most.

---

## 🌫 Volumetric Fog — **Medium or Low**
Huge GPU load.  
Changing from Ultra → Medium often grants **+10–20 FPS**.

---

## 🌑 Shadows — **Medium**
One of the biggest FPS killers.

- Very small visual difference  
- Very large performance gain  
- Great for both CPU & GPU relief  

---

## 🟦 Anti-Aliasing — **DLSS / FSR (Quality Mode)**
For NVIDIA: **DLSS Quality**  
For AMD: **FSR 2 Quality**

Upscaling provides:

- +30–60 FPS  
- Sharper motion  
- Better stability in cities  

Avoid native TAA on mid-range GPUs.

---

## 💡 Ambient Occlusion — **Medium**
AO produces subtle lighting depth but is expensive on GPU.  
Dropping to Medium gives a noticeable FPS boost.

---

## 🏙 Crowd Density — **Low or Medium**
Affects **CPU**, not GPU.

If you experience stutters in cities, set this to **Low**.

---

## 🌄 View Distance — **Medium**
Minimal visual difference compared to High.  
Lowers CPU load.

---

## ☁ Sky & Weather Quality — **Medium**
Dynamic clouds and storms are expensive.  
Medium keeps visuals great without costing too much FPS.

---

## 🌊 Reflections — **Off or Low**
Screen-space reflections cost a lot of GPU power.  
Turning them Off improves performance in towns and rivers.

---

## 🟩 Texture Quality — **High** (Keep High)
Impacts **VRAM**, not FPS.  
If you have:

- 6–8GB VRAM → High  
- 4GB VRAM → Medium  

Textures should remain high unless you have very low VRAM.

---


Below are presets for different types of hardware.

---

## 🔵 **Best Settings for Mid-Range PCs (GTX 1660 / RTX 2060 / RX 5600 XT)**  
**Goal:** 60–90 FPS @ 1080p

- Volumetrics: Low  
- Shadows: Medium  
- AO: Medium  
- Reflections: Off  
- Crowd Density: Low  
- Textures: High  
- DLSS/FSR: Balanced  
- Weather: Medium  
- View Distance: Medium  

Result: +35–50 FPS improvement.

---

## 🟢 **Best Settings for 1440p High FPS (RTX 3060 Ti / RTX 3070 / RX 6700 XT)**  
**Goal:** 80–120 FPS @ 1440p

- DLSS/FSR: Quality  
- Shadows: Medium  
- Volumetrics: Medium  
- Reflections: Low  
- AO: High  
- Crowd: Medium  

Result: Smooth high-refresh experience.

---

## 🔴 **Best Settings for 4K (RTX 4070 Ti / RTX 4080 / RX 7900 XTX)**  
**Goal:** 70–120 FPS @ 4K

- DLSS/FSR: Quality / Balanced  
- Shadows: High  
- Volumetrics: Medium  
- Reflections: Low  
- AO: High  
- Crowd: Low  

Result: Ultra-quality visuals with strong FPS.

---


Understanding bottlenecks helps optimize your **where winds meet performance settings** even better.

---

## If You’re GPU-Bottlenecked (Low FPS in open fields):
- Lower Shadows  
- Lower Volumetrics  
- Lower Reflections  
- Use DLSS/FSR  

---

## If You’re CPU-Bottlenecked (Stutters in cities):
- Lower Crowd Density  
- Lower View Distance  
- Disable Background Apps  
- Turn off V-Sync  

---


### ✔ NVIDIA Reflex (NVIDIA GPUs)  
Reduces input latency — recommended for unlocked FPS.

### ✔ AMD Anti-Lag+  
Same effect for AMD users.

### ✔ RivaTuner FPS Cap  
If you want **smooth locked 120 / 144 FPS**, set a custom FPS target.

---


- Set Power Mode → **High Performance**  
- Ensure the game runs on the **dedicated GPU**  
- Update drivers  
- Close Chrome, Discord overlay, and OBS when gaming  
- Enable **Resizable BAR** if GPU supports it  

These can add **+10–15 FPS**.

---


With the right **where winds meet performance settings**, even mid-range PCs can achieve dramatically smoother gameplay. Shadows, volumetrics, reflections, and upscaling options are the biggest levers for FPS, while textures and geometry affect visuals far more than performance.

Tune the settings above, unlock higher framerates, and explore the wuxia world with maximum smoothness.
