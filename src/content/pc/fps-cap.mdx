This **where winds meet fps cap** guide explains how to remove or adjust the framerate limit in *Where Winds Meet*, how the engine handles framerate scaling, and which settings you should change to achieve smoother and more responsive gameplay. Whether you're using a high-refresh-rate monitor or simply want the lowest input latency, unlocking the FPS cap can dramatically improve your experience.

## Why Is There an FPS Cap?

Many action RPGs ship with a default FPS limit to:

- Maintain engine stability  
- Avoid physics desync  
- Prevent overheating on laptops  
- Reduce GPU spiking in crowded regions  

In early versions and beta tests, *Where Winds Meet* has been seen using default caps such as **60 FPS** or **120 FPS**, depending on preset and hardware.

The in-game settings allow partial adjustment, but full unlocking may require additional steps.

### ✔ Step 1 — Open Settings  
Go to:

**Menu → Settings → Graphics**

### ✔ Step 2 — Change “Max FPS”  
Set this to:

- **Unlimited** (if available)  
- Otherwise: **120 / 144 / 165 / 240** depending on your monitor  

Early betas sometimes hide higher options, so continue the steps below if needed.

Some players have reported locked framerates due to V-Sync, background system settings, or GPU control panel overrides.

### 🟥 1. Disable V-Sync  
Inside the game:

```

Settings → Graphics → V-Sync → Off

```

Then disable it again inside your GPU control panel.

### 🟥 2. Set Framerate to “Application Controlled”

#### NVIDIA Control Panel  
- Manage 3D settings → Program Settings → Where Winds Meet  
- Max frame rate → **Off**

#### AMD Radeon Software  
- Graphics → Custom → Radeon Chill → **Off**  
- Frame Rate Target Control → **Disabled**

### 🟥 3. Check Monitor Refresh Rate  
Ensure Windows is set to your real refresh rate:

```

Settings → System → Display → Advanced Display → Refresh Rate

```

Select **120Hz / 144Hz / 165Hz / 240Hz** depending on your monitor.

While the base game typically supports high FPS, early players sometimes use optional tools:

### ✔ RivaTuner Statistics Server (RTSS)
Allows custom FPS caps such as 90, 118, 141, etc.

### ✔ NVIDIA Reflex / Low Latency Mode
Not directly an FPS unlocker, but reduces latency when running unlocked framerates.

Note: Never use memory hackers or unofficial .dll edits — they risk bans and system issues.

Even after unlocking the **where winds meet fps cap**, your FPS may remain stuck. Common causes:

### 🟦 CPU bottleneck  
Large cities, crowds, and physics may limit your frames even with strong GPUs.

### 🟩 Background apps  
Chrome, OBS, and Discord overlays can choke CPU threads.

### 🟥 In-game cinematics  
Cutscenes often use fixed 30–60 FPS to synchronize animations.

### 🟧 Incorrect FSR/DLSS settings  
Some upscaling modes enforce a render pace tied to your monitor.

### 🟨 Laptop power mode  
Ensure Windows is set to **High Performance** or **Ultimate Performance**.

---


To maximize the framerate after unlocking the cap:

### ✔ Shadows → Medium  
Huge FPS gain with small visual difference.

### ✔ Volumetrics → Low/Medium  
Greatly improves stability during weather scenes.

### ✔ Crowd Density → Low  
Removes CPU bottlenecks in cities.

### ✔ Anti-Aliasing → DLSS/FSR  
Upscaling can boost FPS by 30–70%.

### ✔ Screen Space Reflections → Off  
Not always needed in wuxia environments.

With the **where winds meet fps cap** removed, these optimizations help reach 120–200+ FPS on capable hardware.

Players can use:

- Steam FPS counter  
- GeForce Experience overlay  
- AMD Performance Metrics  
- MSI Afterburner + RTSS  

These tools confirm whether the cap is fully removed.

### RTX 3060 @ 1080p  
- Before unlock: 60 FPS  
- After unlock: 90–120 FPS

### RTX 3070 @ 1440p  
- Before unlock: 60–70 FPS  
- After unlock: 110–160 FPS

### RTX 4080 @ 4K  
- Before unlock: 60 FPS  
- After unlock: 120–170 FPS (DLSS Quality)

This demonstrates how impactful unlocking framerate can be in *Where Winds Meet*.

---


Removing the **where winds meet fps cap** gives the game a significantly smoother and more responsive feel, especially on high-refresh-rate monitors. After disabling V-Sync, adjusting GPU settings, and selecting “Unlimited FPS,” most players can immediately enjoy higher framerates and reduced input delay.

Unlock it, optimize your settings, and experience the wuxia world at its most fluid.
