## What Is the In-Game Benchmark?

The in-game **Where Winds Meet benchmark** is a built-in tool that stress-tests your PC using a scripted sequence showcasing:

- Dense cities  
- Open-world environments  
- Combat scenes  
- Physics and particle effects  
- Dynamic lighting and shadows  
- Weather transitions  

It’s designed to simulate realistic gameplay load so players can see expected FPS across low, medium, high, and ultra presets.

The benchmark generates a summary including:

### ✔ Average FPS  
Shows the overall performance over the full run.

### ✔ 1% Low FPS  
Represents stability — how often the game stutters.

### ✔ GPU Usage & Temperature  
Important for checking thermal throttling.

### ✔ CPU Usage & Temperature  
Shows whether your processor is becoming a bottleneck.

### ✔ VRAM & RAM Utilization  
Essential for high-resolution textures and open-world streaming.

The **where winds meet benchmark** provides a clear, actionable snapshot of system performance.

*Note: Official specs may change, but current industry analysis points to the following ranges:*

### Minimum Requirements  
- **CPU:** Intel i5-9600K / Ryzen 5 3600  
- **GPU:** GTX 1660 / RX 5600 XT  
- **RAM:** 16GB  
- **SSD:** Required (open world streaming)  

### Recommended Requirements  
- **CPU:** i7-12700K / Ryzen 7 5800X  
- **GPU:** RTX 3070 / RX 6800  
- **RAM:** 16–32GB  
- **SSD:** NVMe recommended  

### Ultra 1440p / 4K Requirements  
- **CPU:** i7-13700K / Ryzen 7 7800X3D  
- **GPU:** RTX 4070 Ti / RTX 4080 / RX 7900 XTX  
- **RAM:** 32GB  
- **SSD:** High-speed NVMe  

The **where winds meet benchmark** helps confirm what preset your system can handle.

Below are generalized performance expectations based on industry benchmark tests.

### RTX 3060 (1080p High)
- 55–75 FPS  
- Occasional dips in city areas  
- Smooth in combat and exploration  

### RTX 3070 / RX 6800 (1440p High/Ultra)
- 65–95 FPS  
- Very stable 1% lows  

### RTX 4070 Ti (1440p Ultra)
- 90–120 FPS  
- Great for high-refresh-rate monitors  

### RTX 4080 / RX 7900 XTX (4K Ultra)
- 75–105 FPS  
- Ideal for max settings with FSR/DLSS  

If your FPS is significantly lower, the **where winds meet benchmark** can help pinpoint whether the CPU or GPU is responsible.

---


### 🟪 Shadows  
One of the heaviest settings — lowering to “High” can give +10–20 FPS.

### 🟦 Volumetric Fog  
Beautiful, but GPU-intensive.

### 🟩 Ambient Occlusion  
Lowering this boosts GPU performance in dense areas.

### 🟧 Anti-Aliasing  
FSR / DLSS recommended for higher resolutions.

### 🟥 Crowd Density  
A major CPU load in cities.

The **where winds meet benchmark** demonstrates how these settings affect your system in real time.

---


### ✔ Enable DLSS/FSR  
Huge FPS improvements, especially at 2K/4K.

### ✔ Lower Shadows & Volumetrics first  
Best quality-to-FPS gains.

### ✔ Use “High” preset instead of “Ultra”  
Visual difference is small but performance jumps significantly.

### ✔ Update GPU Drivers  
NVIDIA/AMD release day-one optimizations.

### ✔ Turn on Resizable BAR (if supported)  
Improves open-world streaming performance.

### ✔ Close background apps  
Reduces RAM pressure and CPU competition.

With these tweaks, most systems can balance image quality and smooth performance.
