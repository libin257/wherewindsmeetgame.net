The game expands the field of view properly instead of cropping or zooming.

### ✔ No vertical FOV loss  
Your vertical view remains intact; you simply gain more peripheral vision.

### ✔ No stretched characters or textures  
The world renders correctly without distortion.

### ✔ Open-world environments look incredible  
Mountains, cities, and forests are noticeably more immersive on ultrawide.

# HUD & UI Scaling

HUD behavior is a key part of **where winds meet ultrawide support**.

### ✔ HUD remains centered  
Menus, health bars, minimap, and tooltips stay within a 16:9 safe area.

### ✔ No stretched UI  
Ability icons and text retain proper scaling.

### ✔ Dialogue boxes are correctly aligned  
NPC dialogue and subtitle boxes do not drift to screen edges.

If you prefer edge-spanning HUD elements, community mods may emerge after launch.

# Cutscene Behavior

Like many cinematic games, cutscenes are partially restricted.

### 🎬 **Pre-rendered cutscenes**  
- Locked at **16:9**  
- Black bars appear on 21:9 and wider  
- Not fixable (video file limitation)

### 🎭 **In-engine cutscenes**  
- Often support full ultrawide  
- Some scenes hybrid-lock to 16:9 depending on camera scripting  

This behavior is typical for narrative-heavy action RPGs.

For players with 32:9 displays:

### ✔ Gameplay is fully supported

# How to Fix Black Bars in Gameplay (Not Cutscenes)

If you see black bars during gameplay on ultrawide:

### ✔ Step 1 — Set Windows resolution to 21:9  
Make sure your desktop resolution matches your monitor’s ultrawide native resolution.

### ✔ Step 2 — Disable GPU scaling  
Inside NVIDIA/AMD settings.

### ✔ Step 3 — Select correct display mode in-game  
Choose **Fullscreen Exclusive** instead of Borderless.

### ✔ Step 4 — Force resolution via GPU Control Panel  
NVIDIA:  
**Display → Change Resolution → Customize → Create custom 21:9 resolution**  

AMD:  
**Display → Custom Resolutions**

### ✔ Step 5 — Verify FSR/DLSS settings  
Some upscaling modes may temporarily force screen scaling.

Once corrected, **where winds meet ultrawide support** works flawlessly in gameplay.

# Recommended Settings for Ultrawide Stability

Ultrawide resolutions increase GPU load. For smooth performance:

- Use **DLSS/FSR Quality** at 3440×1440  
- Lower **volumetric fog** to Medium  
- Reduce **reflections** to Low  
- Keep **textures on High** (VRAM-dependent)  
- Turn off **V-Sync** to reduce input latency  

These ensure excellent FPS even on ultrawide monitors.

# Examples of Ultrawide Performance

### RTX 3060 @ 3440×1440  
- 50–70 FPS (High + DLSS Quality)

### RTX 4070 @ 3440×1440  
- 90–120 FPS (Ultra + DLSS Quality)

### RTX 4080 @ 5120×1440  
- 80–110 FPS (Ultra + DLSS Balanced)
